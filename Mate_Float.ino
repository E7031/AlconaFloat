/* 
Controller for MATE Float device. 
  
This controller class runs an autonomous float.

This float functions autonomously to collect data underwater. It will go down 3 meters and stay between 2.5 and 3 meters recording 100 data points. Once 100 data points are collected the float will return to the surface. 
  
Arduino IoT Cloud Variables description
The class contains the following variables:

  String displayText;
  float altitude;
  float depth;
  float pressure;
  float temp;
  bool deployFloat;
  bool led;
  bool readFloatData;
  bool recordData;
